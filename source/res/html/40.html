<h1>Solutions to Common Problems</h1><div class='normal'><br>
<br>
For a much more comprehensive list of common problems and solutions, see the NEdit FAQ.  The latest version of the FAQ can always be found on the NEdit web site at: <br>
<br>
</div><div class='fixed normal'>      http://www.nedit.org.
</div><div class='normal'><br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: No files are shown in the &quot;Files&quot; list in the Open... dialog.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: When you use the &quot;Filter&quot; field, include the file specification or a complete directory specification, including the trailing &quot;/&quot; on Unix. (See Help in the Open... dialog). <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: Find Again and Replace Again don't continue in the same direction as the original Find or Replace.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: Find Again and Replace Again don't use the direction of the original search.  The Shift key controls the direction: Ctrl+G means forward, Shift+Ctrl+G means backward. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: Preferences specified in the Preferences menu don't seem to get saved when I select Save Defaults.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: NEdit has two kinds of preferences: 1) per-window preferences, in the Preferences menu, and 2) default settings for preferences in newly created windows, in the Default Settings sub-menu of the Preferences menu. Per-window preferences are not saved by Save Defaults, only Default Settings. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: Columns and indentation don't line up.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: NEdit is using a proportional width font.  Set the font to a fixed style (see Preferences menu). <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: NEdit performs poorly on very large files.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: Turn off Incremental Backup.  With Incremental Backup on, NEdit periodically writes a full copy of the file to disk. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: Commands added to the Shell Commands menu (Unix only) don't output anything until they are finished executing.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: If the command output is directed to a dialog, or the input is from a selection, output is collected together and held until the command completes.  De-select both of the options and the output will be shown incrementally as the command executes. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: Dialogs don't automatically get keyboard focus when they pop up.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: Most X Window managers allow you to choose between two categories of keyboard focus models: pointer focus, and explicit focus.  Pointer focus means that as you move the mouse around the screen, the window under the mouse automatically gets the keyboard focus.  NEdit users who use this focus model should set &quot;Popups Under Pointer&quot; in the Default Settings sub menu of the preferences menu in NEdit.  Users with the explicit focus model, in some cases, may have problems with certain dialogs, such as Find and Replace.  In MWM this is caused by the mwm resource startupKeyFocus being set to False (generally a bad choice for explicit focus users). NCDwm users should use the focus model &quot;click&quot; instead of &quot;explicit&quot;, again, unless you have set it that way to correct specific problems, this is the appropriate setting for most explicit focus users. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: The Backspace key doesn't work, or deletes forward rather than backward.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: While this is an X/Motif binding problem, and should be solved outside of NEdit in the Motif virtual binding layer (or possibly xmodmap or translations), NEdit provides an out.  If you set the resource: nedit.remapDeleteKey to True, NEdit will forcibly map the delete key to backspace.  The default setting of this resource recently changed, so users who have been depending on this remapping will now have to set it explicitly (or fix their bindings). <br>
<br>
</div><div class='bold'>P: NEdit crashes when I try to paste text in to a text field in a dialog (like Find or Replace) on my SunOS system.</div><div class='normal'> <br>
<br>
S: On many SunOS systems, you have to set up an nls directory before various inter-client communication features of Motif will function properly. There are instructions in README.sun in /pub/v5_0_2/individual/README.sun on ftp.nedit.org, as well as a tar file containing a complete nls directory: ftp://ftp.nedit.org/pub/v5_0_2/nls.tar. README.sun contains directions for setting up an nls directory, which is required by Motif for handling copy and paste to Motif text fields. <br>

<h1>Known Defects</h1>
<br>
Below is the list of known defects which affect NEdit. The defects your copy of NEdit will exhibit depend on which system you are running and with which Motif libraries it was built. Note that there are now Motif 1.2 and/or 2.0 libraries available on ALL supported platforms, and as you can see below there are far fewer defects in Motif 1.2, so it is in your best interest to upgrade your system. <br>
<br>
<h2>All Versions</h2>
<br>
</div><div class='fixed normal'></div><div class='fixed bold'>DEFECT</div><div class='fixed normal'>
</div><div class='normal'>Operations between rectangular selections on overlapping lines do nothing. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='fixed normal'></div><div class='fixed italic'>Work Around</div><div class='fixed normal'>
</div><div class='normal'>None.  These operations are very complicated and rarely used. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='fixed normal'></div><div class='fixed bold'>DEFECT</div><div class='fixed normal'>
</div><div class='normal'>Cut and Paste menu items fail, or possibly crash, for very large (multi-megabyte) selections. <br>
<br>
</div><div class='fixed normal'></div><div class='fixed italic'>Work Around</div><div class='fixed normal'>
</div><div class='normal'>Use selection copy (middle mouse button click) for transferring larger quantities of data. Cut and Paste save the copied text in server memory, which is usually limited. <br>

The NEdit developers subscribe to both discuss@nedit.org and develop@nedit.org, either of which may be used for reporting defects.  If you're not sure, or you think the report might be of interest to the general NEdit user community, send the report to discuss@nedit.org.  If it's something obvious and boring, like we misspelled &quot;anemometer&quot; in the on-line help, send it to develop@nedit.org.  If you don't want to subscribe to the <a href="39.html">Mailing Lists</a>, please add a note to your mail about cc'ing you on responses. <footer>
