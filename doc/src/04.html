{% block title %}Cut and Paste (4){% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<p>The easiest way to copy and move text around in your file or between windows, is to use the clipboard, an imaginary area that temporarily stores text and data.  The Cut command removes the selected text (see <a href="02.html">Selecting Text</a>) from your file and places it in the clipboard.  Once text is in the clipboard, the Paste command will copy it to the insert position in the current window.  For example, to move some text from one place to another, select it by dragging the mouse over it, choose Cut to remove it, click the pointer to move the insert point where you want the text inserted, then choose Paste to insert it.  Copy copies text to the clipboard without deleting it from your file. You can also use the clipboard to transfer text to and from other Motif programs and X programs which make proper use of the clipboard.</p>
<p>There are many other methods for copying and moving text within NEdit windows and between NEdit and other programs.  The most common such method is clicking the middle mouse button to copy the primary selection (to the clicked position).  Copying the selection by clicking the middle mouse button in many cases is the only way to transfer data to and from many X programs. Holding the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key while clicking the middle mouse button moves the text, deleting it from its original position, rather than copying it.  Other methods for transferring text include secondary selections, primary selection dragging, keyboard-based selection copying, and drag and drop.  These are described in detail in the sections: &quot;<a href="02.html">Selecting Text</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="05.html">Using the Mouse</a>&quot;, and &quot;<a href="06.html">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>&quot;.</p>
