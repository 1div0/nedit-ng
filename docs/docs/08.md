NEdit-ng is able to display files in distinct editor windows, or to
display files under tabs in the same editor window. The Options for
controlling the tabbed interface are found under Preferences &rarr;
Default Settings &rarr; Tabbed Editing (see also "[Preferences](29.md)" and
"[NEdit-ng Command Line](34.md)").

Notice that you can re-group tabs at any time by detaching and attaching
them, or moving them, to other windows. This can be done using the
Windows menu, or using the context menu which pops up when right
clicking on a tab. Within a window you can also drag individual tabs
left or right to rearrange their order on the tab bar (unless the
Preferences &rarr; Default Settings &rarr; Tabbed Editing &rarr; Sort
Tabs Alphabetically setting is checked).

You can switch to a tab by simply clicking on it, by selecting it from
the Windows menu, or you can use the keyboard. The default key bindings
to switch tabs are Ctrl + Page Up/Page Down and Alt + Home, see
"[Keyboard Shortcuts](06.md)") but these can be changed.
