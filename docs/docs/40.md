P: Find Again and Replace Again don't continue in the same direction as
the original Find or Replace.

<div class="panel-body">

S: Find Again and Replace Again don't use the direction of the original
search. The Shift key controls the direction: <kbd>Ctrl+G</kbd> means forward,
<kbd>Shift+Ctrl+G</kbd> means backward.

P: Preferences specified in the Preferences menu don't seem to get saved
when I select Save Defaults.

S: NEdit has two kinds of preferences: 1) per-window preferences, in the
Preferences menu, and 2) default settings for preferences in newly
created windows, in the Default Settings sub-menu of the Preferences
menu. Per-window preferences are not saved by Save Defaults, only
Default Settings.

P: Commands added to the Shell Commands menu (Unix only) don't output
anything until they are finished executing.

</div>
<div class="panel-body">

S: If the command output is directed to a dialog, or the input is from a
selection, output is collected together and held until the command
completes. De-select both of the options and the output will be shown
incrementally as the command executes.

## Known Defects

Below is the list of known defects which affect NEdit-ng.

### All Versions

**DEFECT**

Operations between rectangular selections on overlapping lines do
nothing.

***Work Around***

None. These operations are very complicated and rarely used.

**DEFECT**

Cut and Paste menu items fail, or possibly crash, for very large
(multi-megabyte) selections.

***Work Around***

Use selection copy (middle mouse button click) for transferring larger
quantities of data. Cut and Paste save the copied text in server memory,
which is usually limited.
