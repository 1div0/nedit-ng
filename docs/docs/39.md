There are two separate mailing lists for nedit users, and one for
developers. Users may post to the developer mailing list to report
defects and communicate with the nedit developers. Remember that nedit
is entirely a volunteer effort, so please ask questions first to the
discussion list, and do your share to answer other users questions as
well.

developers.
